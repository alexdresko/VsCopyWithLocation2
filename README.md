# VsCopyWithLocation2
This extension copies the text you selected in file with it's location: the class and the method, code block belongs to, and the line number.

Cloned and fixed from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IgorShatalkin.CopyWithLocation

The original author isn't responding to issues and it didn't work with VS 2019. 

I haven't ported all of the code and functionality over, yet, but it's a great starting point. Happy to accept pull requests and the like. Let's make this awesome.
